exoplanet
=========

*exoplanet* is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of time series data in
astronomy with a focus on observations of `exoplanets
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet>`_, using `PyMC3
<https://docs.pymc.io>`_. *PyMC3* is a flexible and high-performance model
building language and inference engine that scales well to problems with a large
number of parameters. *exoplanet* extends *PyMC3*'s language to support many of
the custom functions and distributions required when fitting exoplanet datasets.
These features include:

* A fast and robust solver for Kepler's equation.
* Scalable Gaussian Processes using `celerite <https://celerite2.readthedocs.io>`_.
* Fast and accurate limb darkened light curves using `starry
  <https://rodluger.github.io/starry>`_.
* Common reparameterizations for exoplanet-specific parameters like `limb
  darkening <https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0009>`_ and eccentricity.
* And many others!

All of these functions and distributions include methods for efficiently
calculating their *gradients* so that they can be used with gradient-based
inference methods like `Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1901>`_, `No U-Turns Sampling
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246>`_, and `variational inference
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00788>`_. These methods tend to be more robust than
the methods more commonly used in astronomy (like `ensemble samplers
<https://emcee.readthedocs.io>`_ and `nested sampling
<https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/>`_) especially when the
model has more than a few parameters. For many exoplanet applications,
*exoplanet* (the code) can improve the typical performance by orders of
magnitude.

*exoplanet* is being actively developed in `a public repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet>`_ so if you have any trouble, `open
an issue <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/issues>`_ there.
